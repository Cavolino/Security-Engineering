**Abstract**: *This course, spanning seven weeks, delves into essential aspects of cybersecurity. It starts by addressing personal cybersecurity measures and conducting threat modeling. Subsequent weeks explore diverse topics, including banking and payment security, network and hardware security and operating system security. The course then focuses on environment security, supply chain attacks, and Docker container security. The final week discusses safety concerns in medical equipment, the difference between static and dynamic analyzers, and incentives for security certification. The course concludes with a task showcasing a cybersecurity tool. Overall, it equips students to design, test, and evaluate secure systems in today's dynamic digital landscape.*

## Track: 
**Goal of the specializaton**: The student specializing in cybersecurity will be able to design, develop, test and evaluate systems, software or hardware for security goals in the ever evolving digital landscape.

## Weeks:
- [Week 1, Threats](./Week1): involves describing personal cybersecurity measures and reflecting on cybercrime experiences. Creating a personal threat model to assess cyber threats and prioritize security efforts. Writing concise security policies on chosen topics. Conducting a security audit, including a network scan, account security check, and exploring Wazuh SIEM for file integrity monitoring.
- [Week 2, Banking and Payments](./Week2): involves exploring browsers and banking security, understanding digital certificates and their role in online security, delving into payment card technologies and multi-factor authentication, analyzing card fraud evolution and engaging in a subdomain takeover simulation or non-technical alternatives.
- [Week 3, Economics and Psychology](./Week3): involves various aspects of cybersecurity, including browsers and banking security, digital certificates in online security, payment card technologies and multi-factor authentication, the evolution of card fraud and a subdomain takeover simulation or non-technical alternatives.
- [Week 4, Network and Hardware Security](./Week4): involves exploring various cybersecurity aspects, such as side-channel attacks, the Slow Loris Denial-of-Service attack, an introduction to BurpSuite and thc-hydra and, finally, focusing on thc-hydra for brute force testing on DVWA.
- [Week 5, Operating System Security](./Week5): involves exploring various aspects of cybersecurity, covering topics such as workplace bring-your-own-device (BYOD) security recommendations, side-channel attacks on CPUs, including Spectre and Meltdown, common vulnerabilities and attack vectors in operating systems, and the significance of log files in system monitoring.
- [Week 6, Environment Security and Supply Chains](./Week6): involves exploring various aspects of cybersecurity, covering topics such as secure running environments, supply chain attacks and securing the supply chain and securing Docker containers through linting, image analysis and runtime security.
- [Week 7, Safety and Security](./Week7): involves various aspects of cybersecurity, including safety concerns in medical equipment and the automotive industry, the difference between static and dynamic analyzers and a brief description of one of these testing methods. Then explores the incentives for security certification from different perspectives. Delves into Tietoturvamerkki, a cybersecurity certification, covering its purpose, application, guarantees, and potential issues. Also involves showcasing a cybersecurity tool, providing details such as its name, link, whether it's free or paid, creator, open-source status, purpose, capabilities, target users, and potential use cases.
