# WEEK 3

## Tasks

## Task 1: Lock-ins

*In this week's course material, you might have heard about concept of lock-ins, often differentiated into technological and vendor lock-ins. Provide a brief summary of each type of lock-in. Feel free to share any personal insights you may have regarding your own experiences with these lock-ins. Additionally, discuss the potential costs associated with breaking free from these lock-ins and the advantages and disadvantages of remaining within them.*

**Technological Lock-In**:<br>
With technological lock-in we refer as a situation where a person, organization or also the society, is dependent (locked) into using a particular technology.
This could be caused by many factor; for an organization, could be a significant investment change the technology, so it will be important see the pros and the cons. Changing technology mean buy new hardware/software, train employees again, change old habits and uses, but also be more productive, more security, more modern...

**Vendor Lock-In**:<br>
With vendor lock-in we refer as a situation where costumers are stuck in an old or an inferior product because of ""*financial pressures, an insufficient workforce, or the need to avoid interruptions to business operations...""[Vendor Lock-in - Cloudflare]()*.
There exist lock-in situation that are very hard to escape. A real example that I personally experienced in my life is social media and instant messagers. In Italy we use WhatsApp as the main chat app, but I think that Telegram is much more superior, more functionality and security, but I cannot switch "alone". Not much people use Telegram so I have to use Whatsapp or I cannot text with my friends.
Vendor Lock-Ins are more difficult to escape, it isn't only a business factor, it can be also a monopolistic and collective situation, and the cost to exit is kind a isolation to the world.

## Task 2: Security Psychology

*Familiarize yourself with definitions for following; cognitive-, behavioral- and social psychology, course material and search engines are your friends! using one or multiple of them, explain your rationale for following phenomena:*

### 1. why are phishing attacks effective enough to be widespread practice?

Phishing attacks are effective enough to be widespread practice because are the number one threat against unaware people. These attacks are continuing evolving and it is difficult for an untrained person to know when there is a fake mail or a fake website. There are also sophisticated phishing attacks but most of it can be carried out with only a few clicks. For cyber criminals, launching a phishing attack is really easy and exists also prefabricated phishing kits on the dark web.
So all in all is very convenient use this type of attack, it is simple and could be use, as it already is, a widespread practice.<br>

### 2. why social engineering works on people?

Social engineering is a type of cyber attack where threat actors attempt to retrieve sensitive information by manipulating people into providing sensitive data, account credentials, or granting access to networks or systems. These attacks works on people because they aims to the people's emotions, urgency and fear.
Under pression, person tend to choose and to act without thinking, with instinct, and attackers are prepared to this. The attacks are meant to involve distraction and are made especially for these occasions. 
In order to prevent their unaware subjects mind from "interfering" in the process, attackers often attempt to block it out, overloading it with insignificant informations.
These are some reasons that explain why social engineering works on people.<br>

### 3. why many people have hard time using passwords in secure way?

Many people have hard time using passwords in a secure way because of several reasons.
Firstly this is a problem strongly connected with the memorization. Password psychology is directly connected with mnemonics. Strong password are complex and remembering them can be challenging especially when is more than only one. Lots of website nowadays have different requirements, mix of upper and lower-case letters, numbers and special characters. People are lazy and most of them tend to use the same password over all the websites. Normally they started with an upper-case letter, then the rest is a lower-case word that finishes with numbers and special chars.

        Password1234!

Other problem is the lack of awareness. Mostly of the online users don't fully understand the importance of a password, and also the importance to have different passwords.<br>

### 4. why PGP fails to be effective way to secure email?

PGP fails to be effective way to secure email because of its complex usage and poor usability.People need to understand the way public-private key encryption works, the generation of a key pair and also the provision of the public key to the person which want to communicate with.Other people also need to understand and do all these things before communicating with you. Both people need to keep their private keys safe so they don't become compromised or lost. It is needed also to use a third-party solution, a browser extension, smartphone app, or email client plugin.
It is needed a mix of different smartphone apps and desktop solutions to access your emails on all the devices.Even if all of these things are done, people will still be able to see who you're communicating with and what the subjects of your messages are.
The complexity doesn't match the level of privacy. In Italy we say "il gioco non vale la candela" -> "the game is not worth the candle" (probably more trouble than it's worth)

### 5. why it is so easy to spread malware?

Nowadays it is so easy to spread malware because of the unawareness of people in the web. Mostly of the online users are networking without the necessary knowledge to find or recognize threats.
"*Researchers of BitDefender claimed that malware originating from harmful links on Facebook was the top attack vector for mobile devices.*"
There are bilion of people using social networks and spam links on these platforms are infecting mobile devices easily since they are often platform-independent. 
Social engineering, as mentioned before, is one of the easiest attack to do, and unfortunally people take the bait.
In my personal experience I saw that the target most in danger are the non-digital natives. There is a very lack of knoledge in the tecnology and the dangerous it poses, even if also they are use it.

## Task 3A: Intellectual Rights

*Companies prioritize safeguarding their assets, encompassing both tangible and intangible aspects. This protection involves utilizing legal mechanisms like:*

- *intellectual property (IP)*
- *copyright*
- *patent*
- *trademark*
- *Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs)*

*along with employing technologies such as:*

- *watermarks*
- *software licenses*
- *digital rights management (DRM)*
- *software protection dongles*

*Please provide a brief explanation of each mentioned safeguarding method and cite any known use cases for each.*


### Legal Mechanisms:

1. **Intellectual Property (IP):**  refers to creations of the mind, such as inventions, literary and artistic works, designs and symbols, names and images used in commerce.
IP is protected in law by patents, copyright and trademarks, which enable people to earn recognition or benefits from creation or invention. 
Some examples and disputes:

         S. Victor Whitmill vs Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.
         Isaac Newton vs Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz
         Kellogg Co. vs National Biscuit Co.

      https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/ten-famous-intellectual-property-disputes-18521880/

<br>

2. **Copyright:** is a type of intellectual property that protects original works of authorship as soon as an author fixes the work in a tangible form of expression. Copyright provides protection for original works of authorship, including literary, artistic, and musical works. It gives creators exclusive rights to reproduce and distribute their work.
It protects intellectual property of a creative or artistic nature and often lasts 50 to 70 years after the creator's death. In some countries, copyright must be registered to become effective.<br>
"*The copyright symbol, or copyright sign, © (a circled capital letter C for copyright), is the symbol used in copyright notices for works other than sound recordings.[1] The use of the symbol is described by the Universal Copyright Convention.[2] The symbol is widely recognized but, under the Berne Convention, is no longer required in most nations to assert a new copyright.* " [Copyright Symbol - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_symbol)

<br>

3. **Patent:** A patent is a type of intellectual property that gives its owner the legal right to exclude others from making, using, or selling an invention for a limited period of time in exchange for publishing an enabling disclosure of the invention. A patent is a legal monopoly granted to inventors for a limited time, allowing them exclusive rights to make, use, and sell their invention.

<br>

4. **Trademark:** is a type of intellectual property consisting of a recognizable sign, design, or expression that identifies products or services from a particular source and distinguishes them from others. The trademark owner can be an individual, business organization, or any legal entity. They may be located on a package, a label, a voucher, or on the product itself.
Trademarks are symbols, names, or phrases used to identify and distinguish products or services. They help prevent confusion between brands.
Registering your trademark in the US grants you national recognition and creates nationwide rights.
Once registered, you can use the trademark symbol, which looks like an R with a circle around it: ®

5. **Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs):** 
A non-disclosure agreement, also known as a confidentiality agreement, confidential disclosure agreement, proprietary information agreement, or secrecy agreement, is a legal contract or part of a contract between at least two parties that outlines confidential material, knowledge, or information that the parties wish to share with one another for certain purposes, but wish to restrict access to.
NDAs are legal contracts that protect confidential information by prohibiting parties from sharing or disclosing it to others.

         In the tech industry, companies often require employees and contractors to sign NDAs to protect proprietary information, such as source code.




### Technological Safeguards:

1. **Watermarks:** A watermark is an identifying image or pattern in paper that appears as various shades of lightness/darkness when viewed by transmitted light, caused by thickness or density variations in the paper.
Watermarks are visible or invisible markings added to digital content, like images or documents, to indicate ownership or prevent unauthorized use.

         Stock photo websites use watermarks to deter users from using images without purchasing the rights.
      

2. **Software Licenses:** A software license is a legal instrument governing the use or redistribution of software. Under United States copyright law, all software is copyright protected, in both source code and object code forms, unless that software was developed by the United States Government, in which case it cannot be copyrighted.
Software licenses define the terms and conditions under which software can be used, specifying the rights and restrictions.

         Microsoft's software licenses for Windows and Office products outline how users can legally use their software.

3. **Digital Rights Management (DRM):** Digital rights management is the management of legal access to digital content. Various tools or technological protection measures like access control technologies, can restrict the use of proprietary hardware and copyrighted works. DRM technologies govern the use, modification and distribution of copyrighted works and of systems that enforce these policies within devices. 
DRM is a technology that controls access to and usage of digital content, protecting it from piracy and unauthorized distribution.

         Streaming platforms like Netflix use DRM to prevent users from downloading and distributing their content illegally.

4. **Software Protection Dongles:** A software protection dongle is an electronic copy protection and content protection device. When connected to a computer or other electronics, they unlock software functionality or decode content.
Dongles are hardware devices that must be connected to a computer to enable the use of specific software. They provide a physical barrier against unauthorized use.

         High-end software like AutoCAD may require a dongle to ensure that only licensed users can access the program.


## Task 3B: Freedom of Information

*Other side of the coin, information wants to be free. Pick 2 safeguarding methods from previous part and Investigate and present real-world instances where the aforementioned safeguarding methods were bypassed, highlighting entities involved and the rationale behind their actions. Additionally, report on how they justify these circumventions. Answer in 400-500 word essay.*


The conflict between the need for information to be freely accessible and the attempts to protect it using techniques like DRM (Digital Rights Management) and software licenses has caused significant controversies in the world of digital material.

### DRM
A system created to stop unauthorized access to digital information, has come under attack from people like "DVD Jon" who in 2009 cracked Apple's FairPlay DRM. Through this attack, music might be transferred also in non-Apple devices, undermining corporate authority and supporting consumer rights. 

Visually challenged people have a similar struggle because of lack of accessible content, forcing them to use hacking techniques in order to read ebooks. Although there are audiobooks, the selection is limited, preventing many readers with disabilities from having access to a wide variety of content. In order to highlight the injustice of being denied access to a wealth of knowledge that others take for granted, advocates have fought against copyright restrictions. In their requests for exemptions from the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, they emphasized the need of equality and accessibility.

Another example of a DRM attack is the "Assassin's Creed II" (video game by Ubisoft) attack. Gamers argued that they should be able to enjoy a legally purchased product free from arbitrary restrictions, thus they opposed the need for a continual internet connection and cracked the DRM to play the game offline.

### Software licensing
a legal instrument governing the use or redistribution of software. It became a point of contention, especially in the case of Adobe's subscription-based business model. Software crackers created by cracking organizations enable users to get around Adobe's licensing policy. This action resulted from both pragmatic worries about the high costs of memberships, especially for inexperienced creators, and idealistic beliefs in the accessibility of creative tools.

Another controversy of the software licensing is the famous Oracle's lawsuit against Google, which claimed copyright infringement due to the usage of Java APIs in the Android operating system, was another big legal dispute. Google defended fair usage by claiming that APIs could not be protected by copyright. In 2016, the court issued a decision in Google's favor, setting a precedent for the usage of APIs in software development.
[Google vs Oracle - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_LLC_v._Oracle_America,_Inc.)

The conflict between information accessibility and security measures in these situations reflects a larger social issue. It emphasizes the significance of striking a balance between protecting intellectual property rights and ensuring appropriate recompense for artists while allowing information to be freely accessible, particularly to underprivileged people.

Used ChatGPT to search some examples.
