# Week 7

## Task 1: Safety Concerns

#### Why are new safety concerns sometimes overlooked?

New safety concerns in the medical equipment and automotive industries are sometimes overlooked due to various reasons. One primary factor is the significant cost associated with updating existing equipment. For example, major expenditures totaling billions were incurred in 2017 to update pacemakers and other medical equipment. In addition, putting regulations into practice in the real world is a difficult undertaking. The complicated and long nature of regulatory procedures makes it challenging to keep up with the quick pace of technological advancements. For industries, finding a balance between controlling expenses and guaranteeing safety becomes a difficult task.

#### What are events that trigger sudden chage?

Sudden changes in the medical equipment and automotive industries can be triggered by various events. Changes in regulations are one example of this. Government policy and regulation changes can have a big impact on business practices and necessitate quick adjustments to meet new requirements. Also, security scares, such as data breaches or cyberattacks, can quickly motivate changes in safety procedures and technology. These incidents show how susceptible both industries are to outside influences, necessitating quick changes to protect patient safety and data security. As these triggers are unpredictable, industries must remain flexible, adaptable, and constantly innovative in order to reduce risks and guarantee the security and welfare of consumers.




## Task 2: Static and Dynamic Analyzers

**Static Analyzers**:<br>
Static analyzers analyze the source code, configuration files, and documentation without executing the program. Syntax mistakes, code style infractions, security flaws, and possible performance issues can be found with static analysis tools. Static analysis is a white-box testing method, as it requires access to the source code.

**Dynamic Analyzers**:<br>
Dynamic analyzers involve the execution of the software. These tools analyze the program behavior during runtime. While the software is operating, dynamic analysis tools monitoring the variables, functions, and system behavior. This can spot problems like memory leaks, runtime errors, and performance bottlenecks. Dynamic analysis is a black-box testing method, as it does not require access to the source code and focuses on the software's external behavior.

**Advantages of using Static and Dynamic Analyzers**:<br>
Using static analyzers during production offers the advantage of early issue detection. Developers can prevent potential runtime errors and security vulnerabilities by spotting issues before the code is executed, saving time and resources. Dynamic analyzers, instead, offer a view into the real behavior of the programs during runtime, helping the discovery of problems that are only visible when the programs are operating, resulting in more dependable and durable applications.

**SQL Injection, Static testing method**:<br>
Sanitization is a common practice but it may not cover all vulnerabilities. Prepared Statements, instead, provide a more comprehensive security solution. They offer robust protection by separating SQL code from user input, preventing malicious manipulation of queries. Unlike sanitization, which can overlook certain edge cases, Prepared Statements ensure complete defense against SQL injection attacks. Their ability to precompile SQL queries and parameterize inputs makes them a preferred choice in secure application development, significantly reducing the risk of database breaches and ensuring a robust defense against various injection attacks.




## Task 3: Security Certification

### Potential end User/Buyer:

- **Good incentives**:<br>
For potential end users, a security certification offers a strong guarantee of product quality and safety. Certified products are passed between strict evaluations, minimizing the risk of security breaches or malfunctions. This increases trust. Compatibility and interoperability are also indicated by certification, which improves user experience.
- **Bad incentives**:<br>
If certification isn't required, end users may choose to purchase cheaper, non-certified products because of the lower cost. This decision has a risk of financial loss or compromised personal data, as well as performance issues and security vulnerabilities. Customers may choose not to notice certification if they are unaware of its significance, which would reduce the market's need for safe products.

### Certifying Authority (vendor funded):

- **Good incentives**:<br>
Revenue generation benefits vendor-funded certifying authorities, ensuring financial sustainability. Paying vendors for certification affirms the process's integrity and helps with quality control. Vendor reputation is improved by certified products, which have a competitive advantage in the marketplace.
- **Bad incentives**:<br>
Authorities supported by vendors may have a conflict of interest. Dependence on vendors financially might damage the integrity of the certification process by compromising the objectivity of assessments and encouraging tolerance in assessments to keep business.

### Certifying Authority (non-profit):

- **Good incentives**:<br>
The primary goals of non-profit certifying bodies are to guarantee consumer safety and product security. Their motivation is to establish a safe and secure market. They encourage fairness and make it possible for smaller manufacturers and startups to participate by providing free or reasonably priced certification. This tolerance encourages a varied market with a wide range of safe goods.
- **Bad incentives**:<br>
Resource limitations might slow certification processes or limit capacity, potentially preventing market innovation. Dependence on outside funding may undermine independence and affect certification decisions. Funding sources that are open and honest can reduce this risk.

### Manufacturer/Designer of the product:

- **Good incentives**:<br>
The manufacturer's reputation is enhanced by certified products, which draw in more clients and partners and increase sales and market share. Having a certification gives you a competitive edge by setting your products apart and proving their dependability. It lowers liabilities, demonstrates adherence to industry standards, and offers legal protection in the event of problems.
- **Bad incentives**:<br>
If strict, the certification procedure can be expensive and time-consuming. In an effort to expedite production and cut costs, manufacturers may compromise security standards, resulting in subpar products. Strict regulations may inhibit innovation and make it more difficult to implement novel technologies or unusual designs. If one places too much emphasis on certifications, they may overlook security updates that come after certification and thus miss out on emerging cybersecurity risks.



## Task 4: Tietoturvamerkki

**What is Tietoturvamerkki**:<br>
Tietoturvamerkki is a certification issued by Traficom's Kyberturvallisuuskeskus (Cyber Security Center), to indicate that a smart device meets specific criteria related to information security. This mark serves as a simple way for customers to identify products that have undergone evaluation to ensure their information security. 

**What kind of products does it concern**:<br>
Tietoturvamerkki primarily concerns digital products and services, including software applications, cloud services, and online platforms, that process sensitive data or involve digital communication.

**How does a product get a Tietoturvamekki certificate**:<br>
The evaluation process is conducted by an impartial operator and once the device meets the necessary criteria, it is granted the Data Security Mark by Traficom's Kyberturvallisuuskeskus. This mark is essentially a guarantee to customers that the product has been designed with their safety in mind and that it aligns with both authorities' and consumers' expectations regarding information security.

**What does the certificate guarantee about the product and what it does not**:<br>
The Tietoturvamerkki certificate guarantees that the certified product or service meets specific security and data protection standards at the time of assessment. It gives customers and businesses the security of knowing that the product has been carefully evaluated and has adequate security measures in place.

**My Thoughts**:<br>
Certifications, such as Tietoturvamerkki, are good to both customers and companies. They offer an indication that an item or service has been evaluated and found to conform to certain security requirements. In my opinion, purchasing certified products is good but it depends a lot on what is the goal. If managing sensitive data or performing sensitive tasks for me is a must to buy certified products. It shows a dedication to digital security, which is more and more important in the connected world of today.
However, there could be issues and challenges with certifications. One problem is that technology is evolving so quickly that what is safe today may not be safe tomorrow.
There might also be a chance of relying too much on certifications. Customers might ignore other crucial security procedures in the mistaken belief that a certified product is totally safe. This may result in an underestimate of the harmful and dangerous attacks, which are also subject to rapid changes.
